\usage{
adhoc.twosigma(
  count,
  mean_covar,
  zi_covar,
  id,
  weights = rep(1, length(count))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{Vector of non-negative integer read counts.}

\item{mean_covar}{Covariates for the (conditional) mean model. Must be a matrix (without an intercept column) or = 1 to indicate an intercept only model.}

\item{zi_covar}{Covariates for the zero-inflation model. Must be a matrix (without an intercept column), = 1 to indicate an intercept only model, or = 0 to indicate no zero-inflation model desired.}

\item{id}{Vector of individual-level ID's. Used as predictor in ANOVA model.}

\item{weights}{weights, as in glm. Defaults to 1 for all observations and no scaling or centering of weights is performed. Passed into zeroinfl function.}
}
\value{
P-value from the ANOVA F test.
