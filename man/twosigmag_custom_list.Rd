\title{Gene set testing adjusting for inter-gene correlation using the TWO-SIGMA model of ... with custom user-specified model formulas.}
\usage{
twosigmag_custom_list(count_matrix, index_test, index_ref = NULL,
  mean_form_alt, zi_form_alt, mean_form_null, zi_form_null, id, lr.df,
  rho = NULL, disp_covar = NULL, return_fits = FALSE,
  weights = rep(1, length(count_matrix[1, ])),
  control = glmmTMBControl())
}
\arguments{
\item{count_matrix}{Matrix of non-negative integer read counts. If specifying custom formula(s) via the arguments mean_form and zi_form the expression in mean_form will supersede.}

\item{index_test}{Index corresponding to rows of the count matrix that are in the test set.}

\item{index_ref}{Index corresponding to rows of the count matrix that are in the reference set.  If NULL, a reference set is randomly selected of the same size as test size using genes not in the test set.}

\item{id}{Vector of individual-level ID's. Used for random effect prediction and the adhoc method but required regardless.}

\item{lr.df}{degrees of freedom for the asymptotic chi-square approximation to the liklihood ratio statistic.}

\item{rho}{Inter-gene correlation value. If NULL (default), estimated using TWO-SIGMA model residuals.}

\item{disp_covar}{Covariates for a log-linear model for the dispersion. Either a matrix of covariates or = 1 to indicate an intercept only model. Random effect terms are not permitted in the dispersion model. Defaults to NULL for constant dispersion.}

\item{weights}{weights, as in glm. Defaults to 1 for all observations and no scaling or centering of weights is performed.}

\item{control}{Control parameters for optimization in \code{glmmTMB}.}

\item{contrast}{Either a string indicating the column name of the covariate to test or an integer referring to its column position in BOTH the mean_covar and zi_covar matrices (if the two matrices differ using a string name is preferred). Argument is ignored if mean_covar and zi_covar are both a single covariate (that covariate is assumed of interest).}

\item{mean_re}{Should random intercepts be included in the (conditional) mean model? Ignored if adhoc=TRUE.}

\item{zi_re}{Should random intercepts be included in the zero-inflation model? Ignored if adhoc=TRUE.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{glmmTMB}.

\section{Details}{
  If adhoc=TRUE, any input in mean_re and zi_re will be ignored.
